## 1. Understanding the Basics

### Types of Numbers

**Natural Numbers (N)**
- Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- Used for counting objects
- Example: Number of students in a class

**Whole Numbers (W)**
- Natural numbers + zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- Example: Number of cars in an empty parking lot = 0

**Integers (Z)**
- Positive and negative whole numbers: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- Example: Temperature readings (above/below zero)

**Rational Numbers (Q)**
- Numbers that can be written as fractions: a/b where b ≠ 0
- Examples: 1/2, 3/4, -5/3, 0.75

**Irrational Numbers**
- Cannot be written as fractions
- Decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating
- Examples: √2, π, √3

**Real Numbers (R)**
- All rational and irrational numbers combined
- Represented on the number line

### Arithmetic Operations

**Order of Operations: PEMDAS/BODMAS**
1. **P**arentheses/**B**rackets
2. **E**xponents/**O**rders
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

**Example:** 3 + 4 × 2 = 3 + 8 = 11 (multiply first, then add)

### Key Algebraic Terms

- **Variable:** Symbol representing an unknown value (usually x, y, z)
- **Constant:** Fixed value that doesn't change
- **Coefficient:** Number multiplying a variable (in 3x, coefficient is 3)
- **Expression:** Combination of variables, numbers, and operations (2x + 3y - 5)
- **Equation:** Statement showing two expressions are equal (2x + 3 = 11)
- **Inequality:** Comparison using <, >, ≤, or ≥ (x + 3 > 5)

## 2. Fractions and Decimals

### Working with Fractions

**Simplifying Fractions**
- Divide numerator and denominator by their Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
- Example: 8/12 = (8÷4)/(12÷4) = 2/3

**Finding Common Denominators**
- Use Least Common Multiple (LCM) of denominators
- Example: For 1/4 and 3/5, LCM of 4 and 5 is 20
  - 1/4 = 5/20, 3/5 = 12/20

**Adding and Subtracting Fractions**
- Must have common denominators
- Add/subtract numerators, keep denominator same
- Example: 5/20 + 12/20 = 17/20

**Multiplying Fractions**
- Multiply numerators together, denominators together
- Example: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2

**Dividing Fractions**
- Flip the second fraction and multiply
- Example: 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9

**Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions**
- Mixed: whole number + fraction (3½)
- Improper: numerator > denominator (7/2)
- Converting: 3½ = (3×2+1)/2 = 7/2

### Working with Decimals

**Converting Fractions to Decimals**
- Divide numerator by denominator
- Example: 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

**Decimal Operations**
- **Addition/Subtraction:** Align decimal points
- **Multiplication:** Multiply normally, count total decimal places
- **Division:** Use long division, place decimal point carefully

**Rounding Decimals**
- Look at digit to the right of desired place
- If ≥ 5, round up; if < 5, round down
- Example: 3.14159 rounded to 2 decimal places = 3.14

---

## 3. Ratios and Proportions

### Ratios

**Writing Ratios**
- Compare two quantities: a:b or a/b
- Example: 8 oranges to 4 apples = 8:4 = 2:1

**Equivalent Ratios**
- Have same value when simplified
- Example: 2:1, 4:2, 6:3 are all equivalent

### Proportions

**Setting Up Proportions**
- Equation stating two ratios are equal: a/b = c/d
- Example: If 2 oranges cost $1, how much do 6 oranges cost?
  - 2/1 = 6/x

**Solving Proportions**
- Cross multiply: a/b = c/d → ad = bc
- Example: 2/1 = 6/x → 2x = 6 → x = 3

### Variation

**Direct Variation**
- Two quantities increase/decrease together
- y = kx (k is constant)
- Example: If y = 2 when x = 1, then y = 2x

**Inverse Variation**
- One increases as other decreases
- xy = k (k is constant)
- Example: If y = 1 when x = 2, then xy = 2

---

## 4. Percentages

### Converting Between Forms

**Fraction to Percentage**
- Convert to decimal, multiply by 100, add %
- Example: 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%

**Percentage to Decimal**
- Divide by 100
- Example: 50% = 50 ÷ 100 = 0.5

**Percentage to Fraction**
- Write over 100, simplify
- Example: 50% = 50/100 = 1/2

### Percentage Calculations

**Finding Percentage of a Number**
- Convert percentage to decimal, multiply
- Example: 20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10

**Percentage Increase/Decrease**
- Formula: [(New Value - Original Value) ÷ Original Value] × 100
- Example: $50 to $65 = [(65-50) ÷ 50] × 100 = 30% increase

---

## 5. Variables and Expressions

### Working with Variables

**Variables**
- Symbols representing unknown values
- Usually letters like x, y, z

**Algebraic Expressions**
- Mathematical phrases with variables and numbers
- Example: 3x + 2y - 7

**Simplifying Expressions**
- Combine like terms
- Example: 2x + 3x = 5x

### Solving Equations

**One-Step Equations**
- Use inverse operations
- Example: x + 7 = 10 → x = 10 - 7 = 3

**Two-Step Equations**
- Undo operations in reverse order
- Example: 2x + 3 = 7 → 2x = 4 → x = 2

**Multi-Step Equations**
- Use distributive property, combine like terms
- Example: 3(x + 2) - 4 = 11
  - 3x + 6 - 4 = 11
  - 3x + 2 = 11
  - 3x = 9
  - x = 3

### Inequalities

**Solving Inequalities**
- Same as equations, but flip inequality sign when multiplying/dividing by negative
- Example: -2x > 6 → x < -3

**Graphing Inequalities**
- Open circle: < or >
- Closed circle: ≤ or ≥
- Shade appropriate direction

**Compound Inequalities**
- Connected by "and" or "or"
- Example: 2 < x < 5 (x is between 2 and 5)
