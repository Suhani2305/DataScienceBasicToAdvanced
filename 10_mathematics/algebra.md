## What is Algebra?

**Definition**: Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.

### Key Concept
- It's like solving a puzzle where we find unknown values that make equations true
- Example: In `x + 5 = 10`, we solve to find that `x = 5`

### Etymology
- **Origin**: The word "algebra" comes from Arabic "al-jabr"
- **Meaning**: "Reunion of broken parts"
- **Source**: Book by Al-Khwarizmi (820 AD) titled "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"
- **Process**: "Al-jabr" referred to moving terms across equations (like turning `x - 5 = 7` into `x = 7 + 5`)
